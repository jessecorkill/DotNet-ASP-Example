ASP.NET Demo Project
Overview

This repository contains a simple ASP.NET application created to demonstrate familiarity with the .NET / ASP.NET framework, including project structure, MVC patterns, and database integration.

The purpose of this project is not to provide a production-ready application, but rather to serve as a working example that showcases my ability to:

Configure and run a .NET web application

Implement models and database interactions

Work with Razor views and controllers

Handle file uploads and basic data persistence

Structure a maintainable ASP.NET project
